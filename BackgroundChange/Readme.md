## Overview

This project demonstrates how to dynamically change the background color of a webpage using JavaScript. The project provides two versions of the color-changing functionality:

1. **Immediate Change (`randomBG1.js`):** Clicking the "Start" button changes the background color immediately, and the "Stop" button resets the background color to white.

2. **Looping Change (`randomBG2.js`):** Clicking the "Start" button initiates a looping interval that changes the background color every second. Clicking the "Stop" button ends the looping interval.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Click the "Start" button to begin changing the background color.

4. Click the "Stop" button to stop changing the background color.
